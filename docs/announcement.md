C2C Swap is here!

I am very pleased to announce my first public Decentralized Cryptocurrency project "C2C Swap". You can visit this site at either decentralized urls: https://c2cswap.eth or https://c2cswap.eth.limo

This project will be live to support the Ethereum Mainnet by this month. I am in the process of testing and I need all your helps to find bugs on the site.

Anyone who helps testing will get air-drop of "100 C2C" tokens (or the equivalent $100 USD cash) when the site go live.

This is also a great opportunity for you to learn how to make additional income via C2C Swap decentralized application.

Here is how to participate:
